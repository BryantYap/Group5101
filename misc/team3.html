  Virtual Reality is a relatively new technology field. Only recently did it become readily available to everyone in the form of VR headset for gaming. This rapid developing technology is moving into other field like medical field like exposure therapy. Being a new piece of technology, it does open up options in the fields. However the research done about VR in therapy so far has been on the result of the therapy itself, is it Ethical to focus on the result of the therapy? instead of how it should be administered as a healthcare procedure? It is proven effective for use in exposure therapy. However is it ethical that this technology is so readily available for the public to use as medical care without monitoring from a medical professional while there's little researched about its application? The technology has gotten to the point where it is accessible by everyone despite being new. This also means that there's insufficient research and development in term of its Ethical limits, Application of the technology and its potential effects used on longterm. This technology should be researched in a more diverse manners as well as limiting its development until it is more throughly researched on all aspect of it.</p>
