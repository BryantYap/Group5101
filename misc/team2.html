  As I have used vr before, I could see that it has its benefits and risks while using the product. The benefit is that you’re fully immersed with whatever youre doing in the three-dimensional world, focusing on the task that is running and this causes the user to forget about its surroundings.  
  <br><br>
  After I had used the system, I wanted to go back into the three-dimensional world as it became a distraction from my reality. As I suffer from public and formal speaking, I could see that this would help me with my speaking ability when the correct software has been programed. Right now, there is a lack of programs on how to implement the use of vr for clinical use and as it is a new technology. As there are several programs in the gaming scene that introduces VR exposure therapy to the players, some of these programs are under developed for the most fear driven patients. For example, if I wanted to ease my fear of spiders, there is a program on the steam store right now name “Arachnophobia”, this game allows the user to look around the environment the digital room as you are in room limited spiders. The interaction between the user and the game is very limited as you can only rotate your head and look around your surroundings. There are multiple vr games that helps us with exposing us to our fears, the program itself is not clinically proven to be effective as the programmer does not have the information needed to develop a successful exposure program. A lot of programs that are out right now are based on science fiction themes, vehicle simulations and ghost hunting simulations.
