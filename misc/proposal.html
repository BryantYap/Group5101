			VR uses a computer system to create a simulated environment in which the user can interact with the 3D world. This can be used in multiple ways for example they could be used for military training and healthcare, but we would be diving into VR therapy. VR allows the therapist to create a digital world that can help the client expose to negative stimuli and allows them respond in a carefree way when faced with an agonizing experience. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In a recent report published by the American Center for Disease and Control (CDC) for a study between August 2020 to February 2021, the percentage of adults with symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder increased from 37% to 42% – with adults aged 18-29 years showing the highest increases. This signals that our society could be potentially facing a mental health pandemic and marks a need for mental health intervention strategies.
			<br>
			<br>
			VR’s potential to treat anxiety disorders have been studied by academics since 1992 and have shown significant impact when in comes to treating disorders not limiting to, PTSD, anxiety and phobias. It is only with recent technological advancements in VR technologies, VR therapy has been able to become affordable. So much so that direct to consumer VR therapy software is becoming available over the counter, and this hints at the prospect of a potential lucrative business avenues whose impact to society must be carefully examined.
			<br>
			<br>
			As VR is still a relatively new technology in treatment, its ethical implications are not as comprehensive as other modes of treatment. Therefore, as the breadth of impact increases, there is still a need to formalize limits, side effects, disclaimers, and privacy regulations. Another concern, is that consumers may seek out these treatments alone without consulting therapists which may lead to dismissing the treatment early on, or aggravating trauma symptoms. This brings to light that VR may be part of the solution to combatting mental health, it does not make the need for medications and formal therapies obsolete.
