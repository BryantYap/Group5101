 The website contains our discussions on how VR has the potential to improve the medical landscape in the future, whether it be in diagnosis, rehabilitation, mental health therapy, and training. This embodies the belief of techno-fundamentalism, the belief that technology can solve all our problems. However, we need to also explore how this may not be entirely applicable, and I will be discussing aspects of that within this reflection. One of the reasons  that techno-fundamentalism may not be true can be observed through how much power is held within the hands of big tech companies to dictate our lives. 
  <br><br>
  The improvement of overall quality of healthcare itself through VR has the ability to reduce the current inequalities in healthcare, such as the unequal access to healthcare between different socio-economic classes. This can occur through something as simple as the decrease in the price for VR technology making it more accessible. However, I believe that the use of technology incurs different ethics, and there has not been enough discussion regarding the ethics that apply within a virtual reality. Essentially VR provides the tools to create a different landscape in where it is possible to bend pre-existing ethical principles. For example, is making someone confront their biggest fear more okay in the virtual realm because itâ€™s technically not real?
  <br><br>
  In the realm of therapy, privacy is a big concern, as it is fundamental to therapy, because if patients do not feel safe enough to confide in their therapists then any treatment will be ineffective. Although VR elevates some existing concerns within exposure therapy, the incorporation of information systems brings in another set of concerns. For example, compared to in vivo or imaginal exposure therapy, VR exposure therapy can reduce personnel involvement, and make exposure therapy treatment more accessible for more patients. However, there remains a huge risk of information leakages due to new data created, and the uncertainty of who can interact with this new data. Therefore, using VR in exposure therapy is not without its disadvantages and ethical concerns. Consequently this enforces new areas of ethical exploration and discussion. First of all, there is the potential of the information being hacked, or there are also possibilities of organizations requesting such information for academic studies. Either way, these become extremely possible situations where the ethics of therapy can be violated. 
  <br><br>
  In professional practice, ethics in therapy are upheld by governing organizations, such as The Psychotherapists Board of Aotearoa New Zealand. With the use of VR in clinical settings new regulations will need to create to ensure current ethical beliefs are upheld. However, within the technological realm, established codes of ethics and its enforcements can enter a grey area. For example, is it possible to differentiate the ethics between the physical realm and virtual realm. 
  <br><br>
  I believe that in the current climate with the lack of exploration in the ethics of VR in therapy, we should only view and use VR in healthcare as only a tool to support healthcare professionals in their treatment of patients, as opposed to patients self-administering therapy. This way governing organizations can leverage upon the existing ethics and regulations to minimize its potential negative impacts should options for over-the-counter therapy software becomes widely available. This also slows down the introduction of VR in a clinical setting, until there is more in-depth research of the ethical concerns behind its utilization, but also ensure its safe application.
